## Getting Started
Once the project is compiled and the binary is ran, one can start/pause the sort by pressing space.
Once the sorting complete, or interrupted, one can regenerate and reshuffle the array by pressing r.

### Prerequisites
* This piece of code depends on the [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) libraries, in particular their graphics and audio components.
* It also depends on [CMake](https://cmake.org/) to compile and build.

### Compiling
1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/golfrumors/sorting-visualizer
```
2. Cd into the appropriate folder
```sh
cd sorting-visualizer
```
3. Tweak settings as needed
4. In the root directory, create a new folder to hold the executable
```sh
mkdir build && cd build
```
5. Compile the project using CMake
```sh
cmake .. && cmake --build .
```
6. Run the executable
```sh
./SortingVisualizer
```

- [ ] Make bucket sort more visual
- [ ] Implement Bingo Sort Algorithm
- [x] Implement Strand Sort
    - [ ] Fix Strand Sort
- [x] Implement Bitonic Sort
    - [ ] Fix Bitonic Sort
